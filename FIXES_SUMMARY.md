# Fixes Summary - Earnings, Withdrawals & Trip Filters

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issues Fixed**

### **1. âœ… Earnings Not Showing in App**
**Problem**: First earning was not displaying in the app despite API returning data.

**Root Cause**: 
- Earnings screen defaulted to `'all'` period
- Earnings provider defaulted to `'today'` period
- Mismatch caused no data to load

**Solution**:
- Updated `lib/providers/earnings_provider.dart`:
  - Changed default period from `'today'` to `'all'`
  - Updated `getPeriodDisplayName()` to handle `'all'` case
- Updated `get_driver_earnings.php` API to support `'all'` period

**Result**: Earnings now display correctly with "All" as default filter.

### **2. âœ… Withdrawal Filters Not Working Properly**
**Problem**: Withdrawal page had filters but "All" didn't show all withdrawals across different time periods.

**Root Cause**:
- Wallet provider used client-side filtering instead of API filters
- Default period was `'today'` instead of `'all'`
- API filters weren't being utilized

**Solution**:
- Updated `lib/providers/wallet_provider.dart`:
  - Changed default period from `'today'` to `'all'`
  - Modified `filteredWithdrawals` to return all withdrawals for `'all'` period
- Updated `lib/services/wallet_api_service.dart`:
  - Added period and status parameters to `getWithdrawals()` method
- Updated `lib/screens/wallet_screen.dart`:
  - Pass period and status filters to provider
- Updated `get_withdrawals.php` API to support period and status filtering

**Result**: Withdrawal filters now work correctly, showing all withdrawals by default.

### **3. âœ… Trip History Page Missing Filters**
**Problem**: Trip history page had no filter functionality.

**Solution**:
- Added filter functionality to `lib/screens/trip_history_screen.dart`:
  - Added period filter: All, Today, This Week, This Month, This Year
  - Added status filter: All Trips, Completed, Ongoing, Pending
  - Created `_buildFilterSection()` method with dropdown UI
  - Updated `_loadTrips()` method to handle filters
  - Changed title from "Completed Trips" to "Trip History"

**Result**: Trip history page now has comprehensive filtering options.
